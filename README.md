The inevitable entry of Brain-Computer Interfaces into the market 
has opened the way for many new opportunities and challenges to 
be explored. One such opportunity is the use of 
electroencephalography (EEG) devices for biometric 
authentication. This study focused on solving the scalability
problem of an enterprise authentication system by developing a 
flexible multi-model system that could handle the addition of extra 
participants without retraining the entire system. The solution
combines the use of a convolutional autoencoder to generalise 
features from the EEG signal of 20 participants and then feed the 
encoded features to a one-vs-all SVM classifier for identification.

For the purpose of the study we used a dataset publicly available on IEEE called
[EEG DATASET OF 7-DAY MOTOR IMAGERY BCI](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/eeg-dataset-7-day-motor-imagery-bci).
